In Kyrgyzstan alone, where Al Maimani had just come back from, about 750,000 children- around 32 per cent of the country’s youth- live in poverty. Such figures prompted her to build four schools in Kyrgyzstan. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Some children are unable to receive education due to the lack of nearby schools. Students sometimes have to walk up to 5 kilometers in the cold weather to reach their classes,” she said. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Kassala town of Eastern Sudan, girls often faced difficulties getting out of the area to study in another village until \u003ci\u003eAl Darain \u003c/i\u003eschool for girls accommodated over 500 students. “We could not send girls for education, but the school came to us and made a huge difference,” a teacher in the school said. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough \u003ci\u003eDinarain\u003c/i\u003e, Al Maimani aimed to create a charity drive led by the youth of Kuwait and the Gulf to serve students around the world. Today, the initiative includes 55 young Kuwaiti volunteers who join her trips to build community schools across the world. Besides her trips, Al Maimani also provides training courses for interested volunteers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The initiative brings a new meaning to volunteering through its emphasis on youth active participation in society,” said Al Maimani. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Young people involved in the project, especially university students, have shown great ambition and dedication to providing education to the underprivileged.”\u003c/p\u003eAl Maimani’s life motto is “less is more.” “Small consistent gestures are better than huge occasional donations,” she said. Interested donors can provide two dinars on the official platform \u003ca data-sf-ec-immutable=\"\" href=\"https://www.iico.org/en/initiatives/dinarin/\"\u003ehttps://www.iico.org/en/initiatives/dinarin/\u003c/a\u003e to build schools.","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"If you think two dinars are not worth much, think again.
