Expo 2020 Dubai reflects the world we want to see, and the power of collaboration in making it a reality by leveraging our interconnectedness across sectors and geographies. This new education framework that Dubai Cares has designed aims to transform the way children and youth are learning in order to put them in the driving seat to shape, not only their own future, but also their communities and countries. The bold, collaborative and global approach of this framework reflects the very essence of all Expos, that are known for creating new and innovative solutions for the prosperity of humanity. Expo 2020 Dubai is privileged to be the platform for launching this innovative ecosystem from the Dubai Cares pavilion, and I commend the efforts of the UAE-based global philanthropic organization for always being pioneers in the field of global education.

The current crisis-laden environment requires a new global education system that puts humanity at the heart of education – an ecosystem that can leverage our knowledge, skills, and passions to influence educational and social outcomes, and more importantly, to put students at the center of human development. Through this new education ecosystem, children and young people will be empowered to thrive in an ever-changing world. We made it clear at the RewirEd Summit that if we were to be the generation to truly transform education, then the time to act is now.

As a result, the transformation of education is not a conversation for education experts or decision-makers alone, but it is a space where teachers, education leaders, ministries of economy, finance, labour, and youth along with employers and members of the private sector not only communicate with one another, but also directly contribute to the contextualization of education, while simultaneously working on creating opportunities for children and youth both inside the classroom and the world beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs part of its participation at the World Government Summit, Dubai Cares also hosted a high-level panel titled “The Future of Education: How can we transform existing education systems, make them future-proof, and who should lead the way?”.

In a digitally connected world, we have the tools to share stories on multiple platforms and with that ability comes a responsibility – a responsibility to ensure that stories are told with a dignified storytelling perspective – a perspective that avoids the dehumanization and marginalization of subjects intentionally or unintentionally,” said Maher Nasser, Commissioner-General of the UN at Expo 2020 Dubai and the Director of Outreach Division in the UN Department of Global Communications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“As someone who is passionate about the importance of the visual language, I have seen how the marginalized and vulnerable can be exploited in the pursuit of the visual message.

Many of these stories lack authenticity, transparency, or are driven by ulterior motives which serve a predetermined narrative. These are just some of the few obstacles that get in the way of honest, wholesome and dignified storytelling within development and humanitarian contexts. In order for a piece - be it visual, written or spoken - to reach an audience, it goes through a long process of filtration, revising and editing that sometimes alters the original content and makes it almost fictional. This in turn, ends up painting the wrong picture of the contributors who oftentimes are not aware of where their stories, visual or written, will be displayed and to what purpose will they be used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDignified Storytelling was born out of the need to unite the voices of content makers, editors, journalists, photographers, filmmakers, storytellers, and contributors and equip them with the awareness and hands-on knowledge that will enable them to capture moments and tell stories without compromising human dignity. In order to fulfill this need, Dignified Storytelling kickstarted global consultations a year ago, to solicit cross-sectoral perspectives on storytelling within development and humanitarian contexts, as well as set and agree on the Dignified Storytelling Principles that today serve as guidance and an advocacy tool for bringing together various stakeholders from around the world to form a global movement that will be a game changer in maintaining and promoting human dignity through storytelling. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese foundational principles are also guiding the consultative development of an accessible and practical Dignified Storytelling Handbook which provides ‘how-to’ guidance and concrete best practice case studies. Cross-sectoral perspectives and insights from a diverse group of storytellers and experienced stakeholders from governments, UN agencies, international and local NGOs, and civil society are currently informing this valuable framework and resource.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo truly embed Dignified Storytelling in the day-to-day policies and practices among international development agencies and various storytellers within the development and humanitarian sectors, Dubai Cares, Expo 2020 Dubai and UAE MoFAIC have established a Dignified Storytelling Alliance. The Alliance is a network of champions that provides advocacy, in-kind support, and input on program deliverables.

This will be the ideal setting for strengthening Dignified Storytelling as we join our resources to reinforce the highest standards and increase the impact of those stories we choose to share with the world. The initiative also reflects the UAE’s commitment to advancing responsible storytelling for the greater good of humankind, and its central role in international humanitarian and development efforts more widely.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStressing on the importance of storytelling in the development context, Dr. Tariq Al Gurg, Chief Executive Officer at Dubai Cares and Member of its Board of Directors, said: “Storytelling is a powerful communication tool in both development and humanitarian settings. Stories, both visual and written, provide an avenue for understanding different perspectives and can be an impetus for action. This is why it is important for us as a global community to tackle irresponsible storytelling, a practice that has been left unaddressed for far too long, which I believe is rooted in the absence of widely available and comprehensive guidance on how to best tell stories that maintain the dignity of all persons.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, they have emerged as a game-changer impacting the entire community. Our strategic partnership with WFP to accelerate WFP’s global school feeding strategy in partnership with the African Union aims to support young children as well as girls with their education, while also enabling a positive ripple effect on economic growth through the creation of new opportunities for meaningful skilling, employment, and income generation, thereby playing a pivotal role in the creation of human capital.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe joint programme will play a key role in addressing the learning crisis and the challenges to equity in education as a priority for the achievement of SDG 4 and the 2030 agenda.

WFP can provide the knowledge, the evidence and the technical support to help these programmes scale up – but we cannot do this alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfrican governments under the leadership of the African Union have shown increasing commitment towards school feeding in the continent. One in two school children, or over 65 million children received a nutritious meal in school every day in 2019, a massive increase from 38.4 million in 2013. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in learning and ended a decade of growth for school meal programmes in 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first contribution of AED 14,694,000 (USD 4 million) under this agreement will support the school feeding agenda of the African Union over a period of 3 years aiming at restoring national school feeding programmes to levels prior to the pandemic and scaling up where they are needed the most. One key activity will be to develop and implement the first Africa-wide school health and nutrition database as a continental public good that will promote accountability and ownership. This agreement also strengthens the work of the African Union Home-Grown School Feeding Cluster and the collaboration among its members, including UN agencies such as UNICEF, FAO and UNESCO. The recently launched African Union Biennial Report on Home-Grown School Feeding (2019-2020) is a key deliverable of this project and has been produced with support of all Cluster members. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe work of WFP and Dubai Cares over the last ten years has contributed to a sea-change in how the world views the roles of health and education in the creation of human capital. The COVID-19 crisis has had a huge impact on school children. Nearly 1.6 billion children and youth – or more than 90 percent of enrolled students around the world – are out of school and universities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the pandemic, nearly 370 million schoolchildren are now without school meals on which they depend, 65 million of these children live in Africa. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe effects on these children and their families are dire. For many hungry children, a school meal may be their only nutritious meal during the day. For poor families, the value of a meal in school is equivalent to about 10 percent of a household’s monthly income. This is an economic burden that comes on top of potential earning and employment loss during this pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWFP will work closely with Dubai Cares and the African Union on this multi-sectoral project to jointly ensure that all primary schoolchildren in Africa have access to good quality meals in school, accompanied by a broader integrated package of health and nutrition services.\u003c/p\u003e","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"","Url":"the-un-world-food-programme-and-dubai-cares-partner-to-jointly-invest-in-health-and-nutrition-of-school-children-in-africa","FormattedDate":"16 March 2021","VideoUrl":"","Date":"\/Date(1615838400000)\/","DetailImages":[],"ThumbnailImage":{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/years-in-review-images/image-21b37f57a-3437-4fad-9106-18b8037515d7.jpg?sfvrsn=1344cf9a_3","AlternativeText":""}},{"Id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","TypeId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Title":"Madrasa launches ‘Future Sciences for Children’ Series","Text":"\u003cp\u003eAs part of the UAE Innovates 2021, Madrasa eLearning platform launched a new educational series that introduces students to future science fields in engaging and simplified Arabized high-tech videos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ‘Future Sciences for Children’ video series covers 10 main fields including space, aviation, medicine, energy, environment, modern architecture, and advanced technologies.

The program is a result of the Global Council on Sustainable Development Goal’s (SDG 4 – Quality Education) meeting held in Dubai during the World Government Summit (WGS) in February 2019, where members discussed innovative solutions for current education challenges globally, some of which can be overcome through a teacher training platform. The Government of Paraguay connected with Dubai Cares at the Summit to explore potential support towards the country’s education system. The discussions resulted in designing an educational program, which is in line with the Paraguayan digital learning strategy and the goal that has been set by the Global Council on SDG 4, chaired by Her Excellency Irina Bokova, Former Director General of UNESCO, and co-chaired by His Excellency Dr. Tariq Al Gurg, Chief Executive Officer at Dubai Cares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe AED 11,020,500 (USD 3 million) program, which took almost a year and a half in negotiating and design, is being implemented in partnership with Paraguay Educa, and aims to foster learning among children from primary and secondary schools and support teachers’ professional development by providing access to an educational cutting-edge portal known as META. The portal is developed and designed to provide resources, methodologies and online communities to support and enhance the teaching-learning process.

His Highness’s belief in education as a universal human right, has always inspired us to push the boundaries and invest in educational programs even in the farthest areas in the world. His farsighted vision in harnessing the power of innovation to solve the world’s challenges, has enabled us to launch an innovative edtech program in South America. This program represents a viable strategy to promote access to literacy as well as numeracy for all, and is in line with SDG 4 on quality education to develop the skills that Paraguayan teachers and students need to thrive in this connected and ever changing world. This program also seeks to foster educational equity by offering free and open access to META’s digital content.

This program in Paraguay, which represents an effective collaboration between Dubai Cares and the Global Council on SDGs (SDG 4 – Quality Education), is one of the successful examples reflecting the UAE’s global efforts in accelerating the global implementation of the SDGs. The current health crisis has heavily impacted education worldwide, causing further disruption to SDG progress.

It is also linked to other portals and Ed-tech organizations of the region and worldwide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMETA also aims to eliminate linguistic barriers that would prevent an important part of the Paraguayan population from accessing the resources and will intend to offer the same opportunities to all, by making content available in different languages. It also addresses the low school attendance, while providing access to online education or remote learning, which means that learners will access resources and assignments from home. Moreover, the portal is culturally responsive as it takes into consideration the inclusion of vulnerable groups like women, children, adolescents and young people, natives, people with disabilities and migrants. It includes content for the minorities and underserved population, not only as a source of information to be consumed, but as a space to hear their voices through online communities, meet ups and links to governmental institutions and civil society organizations that support those populations. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We are developing an inclusive, accessibility conscious EdTech platform, that will make quality educational content and methodologies available in both official languages of Paraguay, Guarani and Spanish”, said Eugenia Peroni, the Portal Manager from Paraguay Educa. “The Platform will offer resources that raise awareness of the value of technology in the teaching-learning process. These educational materials, as well as permanent pedagogical innovations developed according to the national curriculum, will be freely accessible on mobile and desktop devices. We thank Dubai Cares, and the Global Council on SDG 4, for their support and we look forward to see the positive impact of the program on both students and teachers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the 2018 Household Survey from the General Directorate of Statistics and Census, Paraguay had a population of 7,052,983 inhabitants with a very young population given that 50% are 25 years old or less; 62% live in urban areas and the distribution by sex is 50.4% men and 49.6% women.

This program is a collaboration between the Jordanian Ministry of Education and Community Jameel and Dubai Cares.

Over a period of 5 years, the AED 20.2 million (USD 5.5 million) TREE program - which includes an AED 5,510,250 (USD 1,500,000) contribution from Dubai Cares - involves teachers, head teachers and government representatives with the program team to develop and refine an iterative process that focuses on two core areas to improve TPD in Jordan. The program also aims to improve teachers’ wellbeing by capitalizing on the partners’ experience to bring compassion and empathy into education-based thinking. Furthermore, the program seeks to improve quality of teaching through a blended learning approach for teacher development, which takes into consideration the wellbeing of children, identification of their competencies and monitoring of their development. This pilot program, which is set to benefit 1,350 teachers and impact 745,000 people in Jordan, will be up-scalable to help millions of children in crisis situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommenting on the significance of this program, Dr. Al Gurg said: “Teachers in some parts of Jordan are struggling in extremely challenging environments such as inadequate support, overcrowded classrooms, and lack of training, to name a few.

This pilot program relies heavily on Pedago’s proprietary and innovative learning solution. The company is developing the necessary instructional courses, which are optimized for smartphones given the high device penetration across Jordan. The concept of MiyaMiya was conceived as a digital curriculum delivery solution targeting refugee children and youth but will eventually be made available to all learners.

Not attending secondary education prevents students from passing the final exam ‘\u003cem\u003eTawjihi’\u003c/em\u003e and receiving the necessary school certification to gain access to the job market, or study further. The success rate for passing the ‘\u003cem\u003eTawjihi’\u003c/em\u003e is only 32% among Syrian refugee youth and 40% among Jordanian youth, thus underlining the overall strain on teachers and the lack of investments in pedagogical capacity for decades.\u003c/p\u003e","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"","Url":"dubai-cares-launches-a-portfolio-of-groundbreaking-programs-to-support-eccd-primary-and-secondary-education-in-jordan","FormattedDate":"17 February 2020","VideoUrl":"","Date":"\/Date(1581883200000)\/","DetailImages":[{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/6d2a0600.jpg?sfvrsn=b3fd263c_3","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/6d2a0859.jpg?sfvrsn=1b5c0172_2","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/4h7a9926.jpg?sfvrsn=42a421a3_2","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/4h7a8879.jpg?sfvrsn=e9f46341_2","AlternativeText":""}],"ThumbnailImage":{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/6d2a0600.jpg?sfvrsn=b3fd263c_3","AlternativeText":""}},{"Id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","TypeId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Title":"UAE community takes millions of steps in solidarity with children who walk long distances to reach school in developing countries","Text":"\u003cp\u003eDubai Cares, part of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives; today (Friday February 14, 2020) welcomed thousands from the UAE community who walked 3 kilometers in solidarity with millions of children who must cover the same distance every day simply to go to school.

To tackle these issues, research is instrumental in finding effective and sustainable solutions to respond to these challenges. Research also drills down into the challenges that education faces in situations of emergencies, and consequently help us to generate evidence for effective preparedness and timely response strategies.

The country, with an estimated population of 32.5 million, managed to reduce poverty levels significantly between 2006 and 2012 thanks to the surge of its mineral exports, but the trend has stalled in recent years. Children in the rural areas of the country are the most affected as they represent 60% of the population living in poverty. Rural areas are penalized due to only 53% of the population having access to drinking water, much lower than in the capital (83%). Between 2002 and 2013, Peru was one of the fastest-growing countries in Latin America, with an average GDP growth rate of 6.1 percent annually. However, the GDP growth slowed to an average rate of 3.0 percent between 2014 and 2017 and raised to 3.7% in 2018. The benefits in the country are not equally redistributed within the society and inequalities keep widening between the large cities and rural areas, where only 44.6% of students finish high school.","CulturePrefix":"en","Summary":"","Url":"dubai-cares-conducts-a-field-visit-to-peru-to-monitor-the-progress-of-two-current-programs-targeting-social-inclusion-through-music-and-early-childhood-development","FormattedDate":"01 July 2019","VideoUrl":"","Date":"\/Date(1561924800000)\/","DetailImages":[{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/c44a3942-min628f3401-0f6a-4b94-bed9-ef86a2a50768.jpg?sfvrsn=2149e2e7_3","AlternativeText":""},{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/c44a1521-minab8bdbda-f140-436d-bce4-70bd588f2035.jpg?sfvrsn=c37d097b_3","AlternativeText":""}],"ThumbnailImage":{"Url":"https://www.almaktouminitiatives.org/images/default-source/default-album/c44a3942-min66820f49-23a3-4dd4-9a22-606f4b5158d2.jpg?sfvrsn=a0da204a_3","AlternativeText":""}},{"Id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","TypeId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","Title":"As part of MBRSG’s initiatives: Emirates Center for Government Knowledge Launches ‘Knowledge Gate’ Portal","Text":"\u003cp\u003eThe Emirates Center for Government Knowledge (ECGK), part of the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government (MBRSG), has launched the ‘Knowledge Gate’, a unified smart portal.

Additionally, 6 women will be part of the 12-person leadership team that helps drive the project to completion. Reflecting one of the pillars of the Year of Tolerance to implement multicultural initiatives and projects, the volunteer group, consisting of diverse nationalities and professional backgrounds, worked together with the local community and combined their wide variety of skills to assist in all construction activities, while enjoying the unique opportunity of interacting with community members and discovering their culture, values and traditions.

Volunteers assist in various construction tasks such as digging, mixing concrete and making bricks, in complete cultural immersion with the local population.

Water scarcity affects over 40% of the world\u0027s population.\nDrinking water is one of the main foundations for achieving the UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals 2030, with the sixth goal being to ‘ensure access to water\nand sanitation for all.’ According to the United Nations World Water\nDevelopment Report 2019 titled ‘Leaving no one behind,’ 3 out of 10 people do\nnot have access to safe drinking water, and over 2 billion people live in\ncountries experiencing high water stress, and about 4 billion people experience\nsevere water scarcity during at least one month of the year. Stress levels will\ncontinue to increase as demand for water grows and the effects of climate\nchange intensify. Water-related diseases remain among the major causes of death in children under five; more than 800 children die every day from diseases\nlinked to poor hygiene. Hence the importance of the award, which bears the name\nof His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum who taught us that\n‘Challenges and obstacles are not the end of the road, but a pathway to new and\ncreative solutions’.
